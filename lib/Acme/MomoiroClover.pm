=head1 DESCRIPTION

"Morning Clover" is one of highly famous Japanese lock stars.

This module, Acme::MomoiroClover, provides an easy method to catch up
with Momoiro Clover.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

=over 4

  my $momoclo_chan = Acme::MomoiroClover->new; // now obsolete
  $momoclo_chan = Acme::MomoiroClover::Z->new;

Creates and returns a new Acme::MomoiroClover::Z object.

=back

=head2 members ( $type )

=over 4

  # $type can be one of the values below:
  #  + active              : active members
  #  + graduate            : graduate members
  #  + Time::Piece object  : members at the time passed in
  #  + undef               : all members

  my @members = $momoclo_chan->members('active');

Returns the members as a list of the L<Acme::MomoiroClover::Base>
based object represents each member. See also the documentation of
L<Acme::MomoiroClover::Base> for more details.

=back

=head2 sort ( $type, $order [ , @members ] )

=over 4

  # $type can be one of the values below:
  #  + age       :  sort by age
  #  + join_date :  sort by join_date
  #
  # $order can be a one of the values below:
  #  + something true value  :  sort in descending order
  #  + something false value :  sort in ascending order

  my @sorted_members = $momoclo_chan->sort('age', 1); # sort by age in descending order

Returns the members sorted by the I<$type> field.

=back

=head2 select ( $type, $number, $operator [, @members] )

=over 4

  # $type can be one of the same values above:
  my @selected_members = $momoclo_chan->select('age', 17, '>=');

Returns the members satisfy the given I<$type> condition. I<$operator>
must be a one of '==', '>=', '<=', '>', and '<'. This method compares
the given I<$type> to the member's one in the order below:

  $number $operator $member_value
